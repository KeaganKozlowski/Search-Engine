# Search-Engine
Building a search engine which will return files on their precentage match with keywords.

Description:
In the past I undertook a project to try and develop a chatbot. After finishing that project and evaluating how it worked, I had concluded that instead I had made a search engine. Due to this I already have all the knowledge and building blocks to develop the algorithms to build this search engine.


Languages:
This product will be developed using PHP for the backend with either mariaDB or mySQL for the serverside and Javascript/CSS/HTML for the frontend. However instead of using PHP I am interested in using Python, as whilst researching for this project I found that in certain instances Python is generally 5-8% faster in terms of time complexity. But for building this project most of it will be done in PHP

Completion date:
This project will not be my main priorty instead it will be a hobby project that I plan to feature on my CV website after I am done building that as well.
Should be done by around June 2024.
